# My X-Window Manager

This is a very simple X-window manager used by myself,
which manages windows in monocle layout and uses
[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)'s key bindings.

### Key bindings

```
[Alt]+[Enter]      Launch terminal
[Alt]+[b]          Launch browser
[Alt]+[number]     Go to another workspace
[Alt]+[Tab]        Go to previous workspace
[Alt]+[n]          Go to next window
[Alt]+[m]          Move mouse to next screen
[Alt]+[Shift]+[c]  Kill current window
[Alt]+[Shift]+[q]  Exit
```
